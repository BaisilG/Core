# Stringier

## Including

This package merely extends `Char`, `Char[]`, `String`, `String[]`, and `IEnumerable<String>`, so it exists with `System`. You can use it through:

~~~~csharp
using System;
~~~~

## Usage

Everything within this library is extension methods, so you will automatically see them through IntelliSense when using applicable types. That being said, all extensions exist within two modules: `CharExtensions` and `StringExtensions` and can be browsed that way. All methods ~~are~~ *should be* well documented. If they are not either consider adding documentation in a pull request, or filing an issue.
