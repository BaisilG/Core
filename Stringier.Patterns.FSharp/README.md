# Stringier.Patterns.FSharp

This project provides F# specific bindings to Stringier.Patterns.

It happens to make use of some special trickery which VisualStudio really doesn't like (or maybe it's my specific set of extensions), and performance will grind to a halt when a file from this project is open. You may want to edit these sources with VS Code or something else.
