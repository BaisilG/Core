Stringier is a collection of projects to make working with text better. This is the base of all of that: a collection of types and extensions to make it easier to find and use what you need.

**Core** holds implementations central to the entire broad project. As things grew, it became a requirement to consolodate certain parts of the codebase. You probably don't want to use this directly, as you'll get a much better experience using the subprojects that build upon this.

**Stringier** was born out of my typical use case of C#: working with text. While I generally really like the language, it could be better. Some of this is syntax related. Some of this is missing features. This project exists to remedy that.

Everyone works with text. Let's make it better.
