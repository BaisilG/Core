# Patterns.Parser

This is an internal, but publicly available, subproject of *Stringier*. It provides a parser for *Stringier's* Pattern type. Specifically, a generalization of Pattern expressions which can be reused elsewhere.

It uses itself to parse expressions representing itself, which makes it quite meta.

It also serves as a basic demonstration of how to use *Stringier* to build parsers.
