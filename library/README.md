# Library

Here lies a collection of books and papers and other documents related to this project. Most of this is archival, after the initial work is done. But there are other documents here as well. `Workbook.xlsx` for example, aggregates the most recent benchmark results from both benchmark programs, always presenting the most recent data, in one centralized location, with charts.
