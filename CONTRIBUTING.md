This has grown into a fairly large project with many different areas one can contribute to. As such, contribution guidelines are actually in the [wiki](https://github.com/Entomy/Stringier/wiki).

Regardless of the kind of contributions you want to make, all contributions should be done through a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) and must pass all CI pipeline checks made against it, as well as a review from a core contributor.
